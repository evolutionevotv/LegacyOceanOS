# Instructions
To enter the desktop, you'll have to modify the **index.html** file in any IDE (can also be notepad). 

You will have to delete line 13 or comment it out as it blocks you from getting into the desktop
```html
<div id="startup" style="cursor:progress;background-color:black;color:white;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;z-index:256;text-align:center;"><img src="logo.webp" style="position:absolute;top:50%;left:50%;margin-top:-95px;margin-left:-75px;"><img src="loading.webp" style="position:absolute;top:50%;left:50%;margin-top:160px;margin-left:-15px;width:30px;height:30px;"><noscript><p style="width:100%;">Your browser doesn't support JavaScript :(</p></noscript><p style="width:100%;position:absolute;bottom:0;">Â© 2019 soup</p></div>
```

The startup phase won't be deleted entirely, it will be there still. For example while you reboot

# Credits
